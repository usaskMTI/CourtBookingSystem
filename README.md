# CourtBookingSystem
A prototype GUI of a court booking system


The GitHub link you provided is a repository containing a Court Booking System written in Java and JavaFX. The system is designed to allow users to book a court for a game of tennis at a specified date and time.

The code includes several Java classes, such as "Court", "Game", "Booking", and "User", which represent the various entities in the system. The main functionality of the system is implemented in the "BookingController" class, which handles user input and manages the booking process.

The graphical user interface (GUI) of the system is built using JavaFX, which is a set of graphics and media APIs for creating rich client applications. The GUI includes several screens, such as the login screen, registration screen, and booking screen, which allow users to interact with the system.

Overall, the Court Booking System is a well-designed application that demonstrates the use of Java and JavaFX to build a functional and user-friendly system. The system can be used as a starting point for developers who want to build similar applications or learn more about Java and JavaFX development.
